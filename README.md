# Machine Learning Labworks

This repository contains various machine learning lab experiments and projects completed as part of my academic coursework. The implementations include essential models, evaluation techniques, and visualizations across a range of datasets.

## 🔍 Contents

- Linear Regression (Direct and Gradient Descent)
- Logistic Regression
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
- Data preprocessing and normalization
- Evaluation metrics: RMSE, MAE, MAPE, R², NMSE
- Visualization and result interpretation

## 📁 Structure

Each folder/lab typically includes:
- `train.csv` / `test.csv` – Dataset files
- `main.ipynb` – Implementation in Jupyter Notebook
- `plots/` – Visualization of model performance
- `README.md` – Lab-specific instructions and outputs (if any)

## 📊 Techniques Used

- Supervised Learning (Regression & Classification)
- Model evaluation with metrics
- Training using both normal equation and gradient descent
- Artificial Neural Network with custom hidden layer configuration
- Performance comparison between different training strategies and data distributions

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries

- Python
- NumPy
- pandas
- matplotlib / seaborn
- scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras (for ANN)

## 📌 Highlights

- Compared uniform vs. normal data distributions in training/testing
- Visualized model flexibility by varying polynomial degree and regularization (λ)
- Analyzed impact of architecture tuning on ANN performance

## 📎 Sample Output

Plots and result screenshots are available in each lab folder, showcasing:
- Training/testing RMSE vs. model complexity
- Predicted vs. actual outputs
- Error metrics tables
